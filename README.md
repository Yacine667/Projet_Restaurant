# Projet Restaurant

This project is an exercise given to us where we have to create the website of a restaurant. We used HTLM, CSS, Javascript and PHP for build it, the first page is the presentation of the restaurant (landpage) and the second is the basket for the client's reservations. We did it in team.


## Description

We have in the landpage :

* A header with the logo, links of differents sections (menu Burger Responsive Screen)

* Home section with a picture and the name of the restaurant 

* Video section with an integration of a video which is muted, repeated.

* Section slider photo with 9 pictures which scroll automatically, with the next and previous button and the slider get stop when the mouse pass hover.

* Section menu of the week with an accordion menu which describe the menu of each day when we clic on.

* Section events with 3 cards wich describe what is proposed in the restaurant, each cards can flip when we clic on for show the description of the event.

* Form section with a booking form and the restaurant informations ( number, e-mail, adress...)

* Footer with the restaurant name and the socials links.
